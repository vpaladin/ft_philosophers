## About

Philosophers is a project of the mandatory part of the cursus.
It's only made in C and the main goal was to understand how threads works in language C and use them to solve a logical problem.
The simulation will stop if all philosophers have eaten enough or if one philosopher die.

- There are three different version of the algorithm :
    - philo is about using threads and mutexs
    - philo_bonus is about using processes and semaphores

- Here is the [subject][1]
